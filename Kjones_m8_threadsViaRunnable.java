    Assignment:
    * Create a class titled <your first name here> ThreeThreads.
    * In this class, you are to use three threads to output three types of characters 
        to a text area for display.
    * In the first thread, you are to output random letter characters such as a, b, c, d â€¦
    * In the second thread, you are to output random number digits such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    * In the third thread, you are to output random characters such as !, @, #, $, %, &, *
    * Display a minimum of 10,000 of each of the three sets.
    * Write test code that ensures all methods function correctly.
